#Data dictionary (code book) of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

##This is after the merge of train and test data set from the original data of  Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory

Only mean and std fields are keeped in the final data sets. There are 88 fields and the semantic is as follows:

•	“subject” → An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
•	“activity_name” → The name of the activity that the subject was doing during the data acquisition
o	WALKING
o	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
o	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
o	SITTING
o	STANDING
o	LAYING
In the following '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions and mean is for the mean value and std for standard deviation
